Hydrus Video Deduplicator finds potential duplicate videos through the Hydrus API and marks them as potential duplicates to allow manual filtering through the Hydrus Client GUI.

Hydrus Video Deduplicator **does not modify your files**. It only marks videos as `potential duplicates` through the Hydrus API so that you can personally filter them in the duplicates processing page.

[See the Hydrus documentation for how duplicates are managed in Hydrus](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/duplicates.html).

See the [Theory](theory.md) for an in-depth explanation for how it all works.
